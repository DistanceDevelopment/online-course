# Design of distance sampling surveys
:::


Systematic parallel line aerial survey of marine mammals in St Andrews Bay

### Reviewing the data

[StAndrews.zip](StAndrews.zip). This project contains the survey region for an aerial
survey of porpoise, common dolphins and seals in and around St Andrews
bay. (For locals: the nearer St Andrews bay region has been extended in
an easterly direction out past Bell Rock, as there are some pockets of
deeper water out there that are of interest with regard to the
distribution of cetaceans. The survey region has a chunk missing due to
a no-fly zone around Buddo Ness, just below Carnoustie). To take a look
at the survey region create a new map in the **Maps** tab and add the
layer **StAndrews** to the map.

The small survey plane permits a total flight time of approximately 250
km (excluding the flight time to and from the landing strip in Fife
Ness, just down the coast). A systematic line sampling design is going
to be used. The design should maximise the amount of on effort surveying
time whilst ensuring that the constraint of 250 km total effort
(including off effort transit time between sampler lines) is achieved.
The aim of this exercise, therefore, is to decide on a systematic line
spacing that gives about 200 km on-effort trackline with the total
trackline length constrained to 250 km. To do this create a number of
systematic line sampling designs with different line spacings, generate
the design statistics for these designs and then the statistics for the
total trackline length to the on-effort trackline length for different
designs.

Before proceeding to the design stage you need to generate a coverage
grid layer, as this will be needed to generate design statistics.

### Generate a coverage grid layer

To generate a coverage grid layer click on the **Data** tab of the
**Project Browser** and then the **Create New Data Layer** button
(5<sup>th</sup> from left). Enter “Grid5” as your Layer Name and set the
Parent Layer to “StAndrews” and the Layer Type to “Coverage”. You should
now be able to click on the **Properties…** button. In the **Grid
Properties** that pops up set the “Distance between grid points” to 5
and the “Units of distance” to “Kilometre”. (This is too far apart for
estimating probabiltiy of coverage, but we know coverage is even for
this design, so choosing a wide spacing makes the simulations run
faster.) Once you press **OK** you should proceed to add the grid points
to the layer. This may take a few moments.

Now create and generate a couple of designs with a spacing of your
choice (some suggested spacings include 4.5, 5, 5.5 & 6 km)

### Creating a new design

Click on the **Designs** tab of the **Project Browser** and then the
**New Design** button. Rename your "New Design" something like
"systematic line test" and then click the **Show Details** button to
open the **Design Details** window. Select the “Line” sampler and set
the design class to "Systematic Random Sampling". Click the
**Properties** button to set the following properties for this design:

- On the **General Properties** tab under Stratum layer, the StAndrews
  stratum layer should be selected. Under Design coordinate system, the
  design coordinate system should be “Non-earth referenced”. (The data
  have already been projected from the OSGB 1936 geo-coordinate system
  using the transverse mercator projection – the same trick we used for
  the MexicoPrj project.)

- In the **Effort Allocation** tab, under Edge Sampling select the
  “Minus” option. In the “Allocation by stratum” section set the Line
  length units to be Kilometres. Make sure the “Update effort in real
  time” check box is ticked. As there is only one survey stratum it does
  not matter whether the "Same effort for all strata" check box is
  ticked or not. Click the "Systematic line spacing" radio button and
  enter the line spacing in the “Spacing” column of the table. When you
  enter a 5 km spacing for instance the “Length” column should then read
  226.203 and the “Samplers” column 8. The accuracy of this
  approximation of on-effort line length and total number of line
  samplers depends on the shape of the survey region, but should at
  least give you some indication of what to expect.

- In the **Sampler** tab, select Kilometre for the line sampler width
  units. Set the truncation width to 2 km.

- Lastly, in the **Coverage Probability** tab, click on "Estimate by
  simulation" and enter 100 as the number of simulations. This is too
  few to give accurate coverage probabilities, but sufficient for the
  on-effort and total trackline length statistics. Under grid layer,
  choose previously created "Grid 5". Make sure the Grid field name is
  the same as your design name.

Click OK to close the **Design Properties** window and return to the
design details.

### Design statistics

For each design run Distance generates multiple simulated surveys and
uses these to work out the statistics for on-effort and total trackline
length. Run your designs and in the **Design Details Results** tab that
opens review the statistics to decide on suitable systematic line
spacing.

### Automated generation of new surveys

To see an example survey, go back to the **Design Details** window for
your selected design click **Run** again this time choosing the
“Generate a new Survey” option. The second page of the survey results
displays a map of the survey region with the systematic lines
superimposed. You can add this map to the **Map browser** and manipulate
it there by clicking on the 6<sup>th</sup> button on the Survey map
results page.
