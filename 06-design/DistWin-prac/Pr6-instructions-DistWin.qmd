## 1. Point transect survey of North-eastern Mexico

### Reviewing the data

Extract and open the project **MexicoUnPrj** from the archive
**MexicoUnPrj.zip**. This project contains data from 4 states in
North-eastern Mexico. Let's begin by reviewing the data. On the top
menu-bar select **File**, **Project Properties**. The **General** tab
gives you information about the location of the project file and its
associated data folder (MexicoUnPrj.dat). The **Geographic** tab gives
you information about the default geo-coordinate system of the
geographic data, and the default map projection. The geo-coordinate
system is used to locate the geographic data (which is stored in decimal
degrees of latitude and longitude) on the earth's surface. The
projection is used to convert these data from the curved surface of the
earth into a flat plane that can be used for displaying maps and
designing surveys. The resulting projection has linear units, such as
metres or kilometres. If you are planning a survey that will take place
over a small geographic area, and you are inputting your data by hand,
then you don't need to worry about geo-coordinate systems or projections
and can set both these options to \[None\]. In this example, however,
the survey area is quite large and the projection chosen will make some
difference to the results. Click **Cancel** to close the Project
Properties window without saving any changes you have made.

Click on the **Data** tab of the **Project Browser** to view the **Data
Explorer.**. In the left-hand pane, under Data Layers, you can see that
there are four layers in the project: “Mex”, “MexStrat”, “Grid1” and
“Grid2”. You can tell the layer types by looking at the icons beside the
names: Mex is a Global layer, MexStrat is a Stratum layer and Grid1 and
Grid2 are Coverage layers. When you open a new project, the Global layer
is selected by default, so the layer Mex is now selected. Click on the
**Data Layer Properties** button on this tab (7th button from left) to
find out more about this layer. The **Layer Properties** window opens,
and under the **Geographic data** tab, you can see that the geographic
data is stored in a shapefile called Mex.shp in the data folder, and
that the shapes in this layer are Polygons (i.e. solid shapes). Click
**Cancel** to return to the Data Explorer.

In the right-hand pane of the Data Explorer, you can see its fields: ID,
Label, Area and Shape. There is one record, with ID = 1. The Shape field
holds the geographic information for that record. Because this layer
holds polygons, the shape record has the word "Polygon" in it. Double
click on this word to open the **Shape Properties** window. This is
where you edit the geographic information inside Distance (an
alternative is to edit the shapefile Mex.shp from outside of distance,
using a GIS package such as ArcGIS). Click **Cancel** to return to the
Data Explorer.

The coverage layers Grid1 and Grid2 contain a grid of points that will
be used for determining probability of coverage for our survey designs.
If you click on “Grid 1” in the left-hand pane of the Data Explorer, its
records open in the right-hand pane, and you can see that it has 177
records. A better way to look at the grid points is to view them in a
map. Click on the **Maps** tab in the **Project Browser**. Click on the
**New Map** button (3rd button along) to create a new map. Double-click
on the words "New Map" to edit the name of the map, and call it "Grid
1". To view the map, click the **View Map** button (5th button along),
or double click on the map's ID. A **Map Window** opens.

The map starts life blank. You add layers to the map by clicking the
**Add Layer to Map** button (7th button along). Click this button and
select "Mex" from the list of layers. Then click the button **Add
Layer** button again and select "Grid 1" from the list. Now you can see
the grid points.

You could also add the points from Grid 2 to the same map. If you do
this, you will see that the grid points for Grid 2 are much closer
together than those for Grid 1. (Grid 2 was generated with a spacing of
20 km, while for Grid 1 the spacing was 50km.) The points for Grid 2
obscure those from Grid 1 – you can change the order of the map layers
by clicking on a the legend "Grid 2" in the left-hand pane of the map
and holding the mouse button down while you drag it down to below "Grid
1". Click the \[X\] button in the top right corner of the Map Window to
close the map. (Say "Yes" if it asks you to save changes.)

In the **Data Explorer**, click on the MexStrat layer to see those data.
You can see that there are 4 strata. If you want to see where they are,
you could create a new map in the **Maps** tab and add the MexStrat
layer to the map. If there are layers on the new map that you don't
want, you can remove them with the **Delete Selected Layer** button in
the **Map** window.

When you've finished exploring the data, move on to create a new design.

### Creating a new design

Click on the **Designs** tab of the **Project Browser**. To create a new
design, click the **New Design** button (1st one after the word
"Design:"). A new record appears in the left-hand pane, called "New
Design". Double click on the name, and edit it to call the new design
"150 random points". If you need more room, click and drag to the right
the vertical splitter that divides the Designs window into two. Click
the **Show Details** button (3rd one after the word "Design") to open
the **Design Details** window. Look under "Type of design" to see the
sampler and design class; the default sampler is "Point" and the default
design class is "Simple Random Sampling". Click the **Properties**
button to set the properties for this design. The **Design Properties**
window opens. The options you see on the design properties tabs depend
on the type of design. In this example, choose the following options:

- Under Stratum layer, choose the stratum layer "MexStrat".

- Under Design coordinate system, make sure the box "Same coordinate
  system as stratum" is unchecked. The projection should say "Plate
  Carree" and the units “Metre”.

- In the **Effort Allocation** tab, under Edge Sampling select the
  “Plus” option. Uncheck the box "Same effort for all strata". A list of
  the four strata in the MexStrat layer appears. Under "Allocation by
  stratum", click the "Percentage from" radio button, and enter "150" as
  the number of points. In this example, we will put most of our effort
  into the two Baja strata (perhaps because this is where we think most
  of the animals of interest live). Under "Effort %" enter 10 for
  Sinaloa, 10 for Sonora, 40 for Baja Sur (south) and 40 for Baja Norte
  (north).

- In the **Sampler** tab, select Kilometre for the point sampler radius
  units. Let's imagine we're surveying for a very vocal species and that
  our truncation distance will be 5km, so we enter 5 under radius (for
  this example we'll assume same sampler properties for all strata).

- Lastly, in the **Coverage Probability** tab, click on "Estimate by
  simulation" and enter 100 as the number of simulations. This is far
  too few for an accurate simulation, but will do for the purposes of
  demonstration. Under grid layer, choose "Grid 2", which is the one
  with the grid points closer together.

Now click OK to close the **Design Properties** window. The properties
window closes and we are back with the design details.

### Automated generation of new surveys

Click the **Run** button on the **Design Details** window. A window pops
up offering you two choices: (1) Calculate coverage probability
statistics, and (2) Generate a new Survey. Choose the second option, and
give the new Survey a useful name like "150 points survey" and the new
layer a name like "150 points". Then click OK. A **Survey Details**
window opens, and the status bar at the top of the Distance window says
"Running Survey". At this point you have to be patient while the survey
runs. Distance is creating a set of randomly located survey points,
based on the design. When it is finished, the **Survey Details Results**
tab opens, and you can review some statistics about the new survey.
Click the "Next \>" button to see a map of the points – you should be
able to see that there are more in the Western strata (Baja) than the
eastern. Click “Next\>” again to see a list of the points, with latitude
and longitude for each. (You could, for example, use this to make a
survey plan to take into the field. To copy this text to another file,
press the “Copy current window” button, 4<sup>th</sup> from the left on
the top toolbar. Then open, say, a Word document and click Paste to copy
it there. You can also copy the map of points by displaying the map and
pressing the copy button, or choosing the menu item Survey – Results \|
Copy Map to Clipboard)

Click on \[X\] to close the **Survey Details** window, and click on the
**Surveys** tab of the project browser. You can see that your new survey
has been added there. If you select it and click the "Show Details"
button (3rd from left after the word "Survey") you get back to the
**Survey Details** window **Results** tab. Click on the **Inputs** tab
and then **Properties ...** button. Under **Data Layers**, you can see
that the new Sample data layer "150 points" has been entered as the
lowest sample layer. Close the **Survey Properties** and **Survey
Details** windows, and click on the **Data** tab of the **Project
Browser**. You can see that the new sample data layer "150 points" has
been added below the "MexStrat" data layer.

### Design statistics

Go back to the **Design Details** window for your design, and click
**Run** again. This time, choose the top option (Calculate probability
of coverage statistics) and click OK. You have to wait while Distance
generates multiple simulated surveys and uses these to work out the
probability that each grid point will be covered by the survey. When it
has finished, you can see the results in the **Results** tab, and a map
of coverage probability by pressing the "Next \>" button. In theory,
this design should produce an even probability of coverage within
stratum. However, you can see that there is considerable variation. Why
is this? What would happen if you repeated the run with more simulation
runs (say 500, or 1000)? (Before you spend a lot of time running
simulations with this project, read the next section.)

### Working with projected raw data

There is a technical problem with the way the geographic data are stored
in MexicoUnPrj. Each time you view a map or run a survey design, the
data have to be projected from the latitude and longitude format in
which they are stored using the projection you have specified (Plate
Caree in this case). This takes some computer time, so if you’re doing
lots of survey design work there’s a trick to make things more
efficient. The trick involves projecting the raw data files.

We used ArcGIS to project the shapefiles in MexicoUnPrj using the Plate
Caree projection, and stored this new data in the project MexicoPrj. So
rather than being stored in latitude and longitude, the data in
MexicoPrj is stored in meters. Run a second instance of Distance, and
then extract and open the project **MexicoPrj**. Look under the
**Project Properties**, and you will see that the GeoCoordinate system
and Projection are both set to \[None\], and that the units are meters.
So, we’ve projected the raw data, and so long as we project all the data
layers the same way we don’t need to tell Distance anything about the
coordinate systems used.

As a check that the data really are projected, go the Data Explorer and
double-click on the global layer’s Polygon record. The first value is
something like x= -12594701 y=3230255 – this gives the number of meters
of that point on the polygon from some reference point on the earth. If
you do the same thing in the MexicoUnPrj project, you’ll see that the
first value is something like x=-113 y=29, which is the latitude and
longitude of that point.

If you’re going to do lots of experimenting with the Mexico data this
evening, or at home, it’s better to use the MexicoPrj project, as you’ll
find the probability of coverage simulations run quite a bit faster.
Meanwhile, move on to the next exercise.

## 2. Entering geographic data into Distance, and generating Coverage grids

The purpose of this exercise is to show you how to enter geographic data
by hand into Distance, and how to generate Coverage grid layers.

### Create a new project and enter data

On the top menu-bar select **File**, **New Project** (or click the
toolbar button). In the **Create New Project** dialog box give it the
File Name “Trapezium” and then click on **Create**. The new project
setup wizard starts up. Under “I want to”, select the option to “design
a new survey”, and click **Next**. Then click **Finish**.

The **Project Browser** will open up, showing the **Data** tab. Click on
the menu **File \| Project properties**, and look under the
**Geographic** tab to confirm that there is no geographic coordinate
system for this project (i.e. non-earth referenced), and that the
default units are metres. Click **OK** to close the **Project
Properties** window.

In the **Data** tab of the **Project Browser**, you can see that
Distance has created a global data layer called Study Area, with default
fields ID, Label and Shape. Double click on the word "Polygon" to open
the **Shape Properties** window to edit the new survey region. Click on
the **Insert Point** button 4 times and fill in the following (X,Y)
coordinates: (0,0), (0,100), (120,20) and (120,0). Click **OK** to
return to the Data Explorer.

### Generate a coverage grid layer

To generate a coverage grid layer click on the **Create New Data Layer**
button (5<sup>th</sup> from left) in the **Data** tab of the **Project
Browser**. Enter “TrapGrid” as your Layer Name and set the Parent Layer
to “Study Area” and the Layer Type to “Coverage”. You should now be able
to click on the **Properties…** button. In the **Grid Properties** that
pops up set the “Distance between grid points” to 2.5 and the “Units of
distance” to “Metre”. Once you press **OK** you should proceed to add
the grid points to the layer. This may take a few moments.

Create a new map on the **Map** tab of the **Project Browser** and add
your new global and coverage layers to take a look at them.

### Creating a new design

Click on the **Designs** tab of the **Project Browser** and then the
**New Design** button. Rename your design "equal angle zigzag" and then
click the **Show Details** button to open the **Design Details** window.
Select the “Line” sampler and set the design class to "Equal Angle
Zigzag". Click the **Properties** button to set the following properties
for this design:

- As the Trapezium survey region is non-earth referenced you don’t need
  to make any changes on the **General Properties** tab.

- In the **Effort Allocation** tab, under “Effort determined by” select
  the Sampler angle option. In the “Allocation by stratum” section set
  the Line length units to be Metres. Make sure the “Update effort in
  real time” check box is ticked. As there is only one survey stratum it
  does not matter whether the "Same effort for all strata" check box is
  ticked or not. The "Absolute values" radio button is the only one
  available when effort is determined by sampler angle. Enter 75 in the
  “Angle” (measured in degrees) column of the table. The “Length” column
  should now read 463.644. The accuracy of this approximation of zigzag
  length depends on the shape of the survey region, but should be
  relatively accurate for convex survey regions.

- In the **Sampler** tab, set the width to 1 meter.

- Lastly, in the **Coverage Probability** tab, click on "Estimate by
  simulation" and enter 100 as the number of simulations. Under grid
  layer, choose previously created "TrapGrid".

Click OK to close the **Design Properties** window and return to the
design details.

### Design statistics

Run your design to work out the coverage probabilities - this design
will take a while to run! In the second page of the **Design Details
Results** tab that opens when its finished, take a look at the coverage
probabilities map. Note how uneven these probabilities are and how they
increase as the trapezium height decreases for the equal angle zigzag
design.

### Additional investigations

If you are particularly interested in zigzag surveying, you might want
to come back to this exercise after completing exercise 3, and compare
the coverage probabilities of the three different types of zigzag
designs. You can do this when you get home. For now, skip ahead to
exercise 3.

For work on your own:

Create two new designs - one for the equal spaced zigzag and one for the
adjusted angle zigzag. To facilitate comparisons, you want to set
properties for both that are somewhat equivalent to those for the equal
angle design. You can see the mean trackline length for the equal angle
design in its Results tab (about 460 metres). You can then set the
effort allocation for the two new designs to be the same as this value.
Make sure that the Coverage probability tab shows “Estimate by
simulation” and that you have an appropriate Grid Field Name.

Try creating a few surveys for each design, so you can see how they
differ. Then run the coverage probability simulations. How do the
coverage probabilities for the 3 designs differ? You may need more
simulations to see a strong difference between the equal spacing and
adjusted angle design.

## 3. Systematic parallel line aerial survey of marine mammals in St Andrews bay

### Reviewing the data

<img src="./media/image1.jpeg" style="width:2.04306in;height:2.29792in"
alt="File:Bell Rock Lighthouse.jpg" />Open the project archived in
**StAndrews.zip**. This project contains the survey region for an aerial
survey of porpoise, common dolphins and seals in and around St Andrews
bay. (For locals: the nearer St Andrews bay region has been extended in
an easterly direction out past Bell Rock, as there are some pockets of
deeper water out there that are of interest with regard to the
distribution of cetaceans. The survey region has a chunk missing due to
a no-fly zone around Buddo Ness, just below Carnoustie). To take a look
at the survey region create a new map in the **Maps** tab and add the
layer **StAndrews** to the map.

The small survey plane permits a total flight time of approximately 250
km (excluding the flight time to and from the landing strip in Fife
Ness, just down the coast). A systematic line sampling design is going
to be used. The design should maximise the amount of on effort surveying
time whilst ensuring that the constraint of 250 km total effort
(including off effort transit time between sampler lines) is achieved.
The aim of this exercise, therefore, is to decide on a systematic line
spacing that gives about 200 km on-effort trackline with the total
trackline length constrained to 250 km. To do this create a number of
systematic line sampling designs with different line spacings, generate
the design statistics for these designs and then the statistics for the
total trackline length to the on-effort trackline length for different
designs.

Before proceeding to the design stage you need to generate a coverage
grid layer, as this will be needed to generate design statistics.

### Generate a coverage grid layer

To generate a coverage grid layer click on the **Data** tab of the
**Project Browser** and then the **Create New Data Layer** button
(5<sup>th</sup> from left). Enter “Grid5” as your Layer Name and set the
Parent Layer to “StAndrews” and the Layer Type to “Coverage”. You should
now be able to click on the **Properties…** button. In the **Grid
Properties** that pops up set the “Distance between grid points” to 5
and the “Units of distance” to “Kilometre”. (This is too far apart for
estimating probabiltiy of coverage, but we know coverage is even for
this design, so choosing a wide spacing makes the simulations run
faster.) Once you press **OK** you should proceed to add the grid points
to the layer. This may take a few moments.

Now create and generate a couple of designs with a spacing of your
choice (some suggested spacings include 4.5, 5, 5.5 & 6 km)

### Creating a new design

Click on the **Designs** tab of the **Project Browser** and then the
**New Design** button. Rename your "New Design" something like
"systematic line test" and then click the **Show Details** button to
open the **Design Details** window. Select the “Line” sampler and set
the design class to "Systematic Random Sampling". Click the
**Properties** button to set the following properties for this design:

- On the **General Properties** tab under Stratum layer, the StAndrews
  stratum layer should be selected. Under Design coordinate system, the
  design coordinate system should be “Non-earth referenced”. (The data
  have already been projected from the OSGB 1936 geo-coordinate system
  using the transverse mercator projection – the same trick we used for
  the MexicoPrj project.)

- In the **Effort Allocation** tab, under Edge Sampling select the
  “Minus” option. In the “Allocation by stratum” section set the Line
  length units to be Kilometres. Make sure the “Update effort in real
  time” check box is ticked. As there is only one survey stratum it does
  not matter whether the "Same effort for all strata" check box is
  ticked or not. Click the "Systematic line spacing" radio button and
  enter the line spacing in the “Spacing” column of the table. When you
  enter a 5 km spacing for instance the “Length” column should then read
  226.203 and the “Samplers” column 8. The accuracy of this
  approximation of on-effort line length and total number of line
  samplers depends on the shape of the survey region, but should at
  least give you some indication of what to expect.

- In the **Sampler** tab, select Kilometre for the line sampler width
  units. Set the truncation width to 2 km.

- Lastly, in the **Coverage Probability** tab, click on "Estimate by
  simulation" and enter 100 as the number of simulations. This is too
  few to give accurate coverage probabilities, but sufficient for the
  on-effort and total trackline length statistics. Under grid layer,
  choose previously created "Grid 5". Make sure the Grid field name is
  the same as your design name.

Click OK to close the **Design Properties** window and return to the
design details.

### Design statistics

For each design run Distance generates multiple simulated surveys and
uses these to work out the statistics for on-effort and total trackline
length. Run your designs and in the **Design Details Results** tab that
opens review the statistics to decide on suitable systematic line
spacing.

### Automated generation of new surveys

To see an example survey, go back to the **Design Details** window for
your selected design click **Run** again this time choosing the
“Generate a new Survey” option. The second page of the survey results
displays a map of the survey region with the systematic lines
superimposed. You can add this map to the **Map browser** and manipulate
it there by clicking on the 6<sup>th</sup> button on the Survey map
results page.
