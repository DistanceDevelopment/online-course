## Systematic parallel line aerial survey of marine mammals in St Andrews bay

I derived the following results (yours will be slightly different because the survey locations in each simulation are selected at random). See also the project archived in [StAndrewsSolutions.zip](StAndrewsSolutions.zip)

| Trackline spacing | On effort trackline length (min) |  max     |     mean      | Total trackline length (min) |  max     |   mean        |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------|-----------|------------------------|-------|-----------|
| 4.5               | 206.6                      | 228.8 | 219.6     | 249.3                  | 275.3 | 264.7     |
| 5.0               | 184.4                      | 205.6 | **198.2** | 220.5                  | 248.8 | **242.5** |
| 5.5               | 169.7                      | 189.5 | 178.9     | 217.1                  | 245.3 | 224.7     |
| 6.0               | 152.8                      | 176.1 | 162.1     | 183.7                  | 220.7 | 206.1     |

Based on these, the 5.0km spacing seems to get us closest to our goal of 200km on effort for 250km total trackline length. The maximum total trackline length did not exceed 250km which is re-assuring if this is an absolute upper limit.

I generated one realization of this 5km design, which we will use as the survey plan. It gave me a total trackline of 226.2km, with 184.6km on effort (see [StAndrewsSolutions.zip](StAndrewsSolutions.zip) project file). While this is rather less than I wanted, I can not validly throw this one away and generate another as we could no longer validly claim to have a random start point (I would effectively only be choosing start points that lead to the amount of trackline length I want) and so would no longer have even coverage probability.

As an aside, it is also interesting to look at the proportion of the total survey time spent on effort â€“ reported in Distance as the proportion on effort/total effort:

| Trackline spacing | Mean on effort / total effort |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 4.5               | 0.83                          |
| 5.0               | 0.82                          |
| 5.5               | 0.80                          |
| 6.0               | 0.78                          |

Not surprisingly, the greater the spacing between tracklines, the smaller the proportion of time we spend on effort as we have to spend time flying between the transect lines.
