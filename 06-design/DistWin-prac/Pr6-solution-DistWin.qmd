The first 3 designs show results for the equal angle, equal spaced and
adjusted angle zigzag designs based on 100 simulations. Even from this
small number of runs, it is clear that for the equal angle design
coverage probability tends to increase as you move from the right of the
survey area, where the trapezium is tall, to the left where the
trapezium is shorter. It is easy to see why this is happening by looking
at a survey generated using this design (survey 1). For the equal spaced
and adjusted angle designs, there doesn't seem to be any pattern in the
variation in estimated coverage probability. This variability is largely
due to Monte-Carlo error, because we've only done 100 simulations, so
before drawing conclusions about these designs, we repeated the exercise
with more 10 000 simulations.

These results are shown in designs 4-6. Design 4 is the equal angle
zigzag and the pattern of increasing coverage with decreasing trapezium
height is now very clear. What about the other two designs? The equal
spaced design (Design 5) still looks pretty good, but if you look
carefully, there is a hint that coverage is slightly lower on the left
side and higher on the right. The coverage probability standard
deviation is 0.011. Compare this with the standard deviation for the
adjusted angle design (Design 6) – 0.007. Also look at the coverage
probability map for the adjusted angle design – there is no evidence of
any pattern in coverage probability. We conclude that the equal spaced
design has close to even coverage probability, but that only the
adjusted angle design has completely even coverage probability.

Note that this result only applies for the adjusted angle design if the
study area width is constant perpendicular to the design access. If you
try repeating the exercise with a triangular-shaped study area, you will
find out that even the adjusted angle design will not have even coverage
probability.

## 3. Systematic parallel line aerial survey of marine mammals in St Andrews bay

I got the following results (yours will be slightly different because
the survey locations in each simulation are selected at random). See
also the project archived in StAndrewsSolutions.zip

|-------------------|----------------------------|-------|-----------|------------------------|-------|-----------|
| Trackline spacing | On effort trackline length |       |           | Total trackline length |       |           |

| 4.5               | 206.6                      | 228.8 | 219.6     | 249.3                  | 275.3 | 264.7     |
| 5.0               | 184.4                      | 205.6 | **198.2** | 220.5                  | 248.8 | **242.5** |
| 5.5               | 169.7                      | 189.5 | 178.9     | 217.1                  | 245.3 | 224.7     |
| 6.0               | 152.8                      | 176.1 | 162.1     | 183.7                  | 220.7 | 206.1     |

Based on these, the 5.0km spacing seems to get us closest to our goal of
200km on effort for 250km total trackline length. The maximum total
trackline length didn't exceed 250km which is re-assuring if this is an
absolute upper limit.

I went ahead and generated one realization of this 5km design, which we
will use as the survey plan. It gave me a total trackline of 226.2km,
with 184.6km on effort (see StAndrewsSolutions project file). While this
is rather less than I wanted, I can't validly throw this one away and
generate another as we could no longer validly claim to have a random
start point (I'd effectively only be choosing start points that lead to
the amount of trackline length I want) and so would no longer have even
coverage probability.

As an aside, it is also interesting to look at the proportion of the
total survey time spent on effort – reported in Distance as the
proportion on effort/total effort:

|                   |                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Trackline spacing | Mean on effort / total effort |
| 4.5               | 0.83                          |
| 5.0               | 0.82                          |
| 5.5               | 0.80                          |
| 6.0               | 0.78                          |

Not surprisingly, the greater the spacing between tracklines, the
smaller the proportion of time we spend on effort as we have to spend
time flying between the transect lines.
