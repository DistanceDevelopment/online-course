## Analysis of stratified surveys


::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}
Carrying on from the discussion of survey design where stratification was introduced, this exercise describes multiple analyses of a single data set.

Multiple analyses arise because it is an open question whether a single detection function is appropriate for different strata that might sharply contrast in their vegetation that might influence detectability.

Employing an inappropriate detection function will invalidate population inferences; consequently it is important to have a decision framework that can be employed to determine the role stratification should play in the detection function.
