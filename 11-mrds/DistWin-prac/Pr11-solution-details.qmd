In class exercise – true n is 64

Class computer exercise:

- More complex mrds model selected by AIC, had better goodness of fit.
  Also less bias (although we only know that because we know the true
  number)

- Point independence even better.

- Generally g0 is very high! – so is all this worth it?

True number is 760.

Next day

- Ask about models people got – which was best.

- Look through Distance results perhaps interpret?

- Look at a PI model – best has sex as a covariate in det func.

- Mention CDS model less biased.
