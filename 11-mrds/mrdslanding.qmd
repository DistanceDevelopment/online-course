## Analysis of double platform data

::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}
A fundamental assumption of “conventional” distance sampling is that we detect all animals at zero distance – i.e., that g(0)=1.  In some circumstances this assumption is violated, for example in shipboard surveys of marine mammals where they may be underwater or obscured by waves when the observer looks for them even right on the transect line.   

Here we introduce an extended type of distance sampling that can help deal with this issue: the use of two independent observation teams, sometimes called “double platform” (because on ships they operate from different physical platforms).  The analysis approach used on double platform data is called “Mark Recapture Distance Sampling” (MRDS).

We introduce the topic with a lecture, and follow up with an exercise that covers two datasets: an artificial survey of a known population of golf tees in St Andrews (to illustrate the concepts), and a real-world survey of crabeater seals in Antarctica (@Southwell2007).

**Further reading on MRDS**

- See @Burt2014 for a paper introducing MRDS methods.  This is more accessible than the original MRDS reference [@Laake2004].
- @Borchers2006 develop point independence methods.
- @Buckland2010 go one step futher with "limiting independence" methods - but there is no accessible software to implement this.
- @Laake2011 extend the methods to point transect surveys.
