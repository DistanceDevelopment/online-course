# Introduction to Distance Sampling with duck nest data
### Distance for Windows exercise
:::

## Working on the computer

- Install the Distance software:
  - Download and install the Distance software from [http://distancesampling.org/Distance/distance75download.html](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/distance75download.html), if you have not already. 
- Acquire the `Distance` project for this exercise:
  - Click on [this link](Ducknest exercise2023.zip) to access data to be used in this exercise. You will be asked to save this file to your local computer. Remember the location where you saved the file, as you will be opening it in the next step.
- We are going to work with a project called “Ducknest exercise”. It contains the same data you previously analysed by hand. Open the Distance software and  select **File** followed by **Open project**. Under “**Files of type**” choose **Zip archive files (\*.zip).**

## Other `Distance` projects
The Sample Projects folder created when you installed the `Distance` software, contains a number of other data sets, not related to this training workshop.  You may want to look at those projects at a later date.
:::


- Double click on **Ducknest exercise.zip**. Click **OK** to unpack the project into the current directory and open it. Next time you open the project, you can open the file *Ducknest exercise.dst* directly.

## Examining the data

- Click on the **Data** tab of the **Project Browser** to show the  **Data Explorer**. Look at the data structure, and in particular how  the distance data have been entered. (You will need to click on  **Observation** in the left hand pane of the Data Explorer to see this.)

## Studying the first analysis

- Click on the **Analysis** tab of the **Project Browser** to show  the **Analysis Browser**. You should see one analysis listed, called  “Half-normal no adjustments.” Double-click on the grey status button  for this analysis to open the **Analysis Inputs** tab for this  analysis (you can do the same thing by clicking the 3<sup>rd</sup>  button after “Analysis:” on the Analysis Browser menu bar, or by  choosing **Analyses** then **Analysis Details...** from the menu bar  at the top).

- A grey status icon indicates that this analysis has yet to be run.  Click on the **Run** button in order to run the analysis. The  **Results** tab should turn green.
- Click on the **Results** tab to see the results, and use the **Next  \>** button to move through the pages of results, looking at each page  and trying to relate the analysis given here to the one you did by  hand. (**Note:** These are the analysis details (Inputs/Log/Results) for one analysis – you can resize this window so that you can view  details from multiple analyses when you have more than one analysis to examine).
