# Introduction to Distance Sampling with duck nest data

- Once youâ€™ve run the analysis, and open the Analysis Details window for that analysis, your screen should look something like this (see below). Distance gets a density estimate of 49.697 nests km<sup>-2</sup>, similar to the value we obtained by hand of 48.9 nests km<sup>-2</sup>.
