# Introduction to Distance Sampling

**Line transect estimation using Distance**

**1(a).** The line transect data immediately below were generated from a
half-normal model.

- Open a new project (click on **File** then on **New project ...**),
  name it, and click on **Create**. Step through the New Project Setup
  Wizard (you should not need to change any of the defaults, except the
  units for density estimates to km<sup>2</sup> not the default
  hectares, but study each page) and click on **Finish**. This takes you
  to the Data Entry Wizard. Click **Next** until you get to the “line
  transect” page Step 4 of 6: Sample layer. Enter say the first 6 line
  labels (e.g. “line 1”, “line 2”, …) and lengths (5, 2, …). You need to
  click on the “append new record after current” button on the menu bar
  or type CTRL + Enter together before entering the information for each
  line.

- When you have finished, click on **Next** and enter the distances
  corresponding to each observation in a similar fashion (using CTRL +
  Enter between each observation). Once you have entered the distance
  data, go to the analysis browser, and carry out an analysis of these
  data using the half-normal detection function key.

**(b)** The full data set is in project **Exercise3.zip** Choose Open
project and select zip file type.

- Experiment with keys other than the half-normal (uniform, hazard-rate
  and negative exponential), to assess whether these data can be
  satisfactorily analysed using the wrong model.

- For each key, determine a suitable truncation point, and decide on
  whether, and which, adjustments are needed. Truncation points come
  under the data filter – click **New…** in the **Data Filter** section
  and create and name your own data filter, including truncation. In the
  example data filter below, the largest 10% of distances were truncated
  – you may want to truncate at a specific distance, depending on the
  data.

- Given that the true density was 79.8 animals / km<sup>2</sup> for
  these data, how do bias and precision compare between models?

Additional question***

**2.** Below are perpendicular distance data (m) from line transect
surveys of capercaillie (a large grouse) in Scotland. Total line length
was 240km. The data are also in a text file **capercaillie.txt** in the
Distance project directory. In the text file, column 1 is the transect
number, column 2 is the transect length and column 3 is perpendicular
distance. Columns are separated by tab characters. Create a new Distance
project and either enter the data by hand or use the **Data Import
Wizard** (Tools \> Import Data Wizard) to import the data from the text
file. Then decide on a suitable model for the detection function and
estimate bird density.
