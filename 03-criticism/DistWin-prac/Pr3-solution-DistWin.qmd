# Introduction to Distance Sampling

Line transect analysis with Distance

1a) Results of estimating density from simulated data in which true
density was 79.8 per km<sup>2</sup>. Findings from some candidate
models:

Not surprisingly for these data (simulated from a half normal detection
function with a broad shoulder), the negative exponential model gives a
higher estimate than the others, although the confidence interval still
includes the true density. The other models provide very similar
estimates, though precision is slightly worse for the hazard-rate model
(because more parameters fitted). Agreement between the estimate and the
known true density is less good if you do not truncate the data, or do
not truncate them sufficiently. Take home message: With care, we can get
reliable estimates using the wrong model (the data were simulated using
a half-normal detection function).

## Additional question

2\) These capercaillie data are reasonably well-behaved and different
models that fit the data well should give similar results. Note the
rounding in the distance data. This means that interval cutpoints for
histograms and goodness-of-fit testing, and for the analysis of grouped
data if this is required, should be chosen with care (i.e., distance
bands ought to be sufficiently broad such that the ‘correct’
perpendicular distance is in the bands containing the rounded recorded
value. e.g. 0, 7.5, 17.5, 27.5, …
