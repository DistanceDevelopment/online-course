    "text": "1. and 2. Estimation of p; FI - MR dist and FI - MR dist+size+sex+exp\n\nThe model with more covariates is modelling more of the heterogeneity in detection probability and so should be less biased. This seems to be the case: the estimated N for the model “FI – MR dist + size + sex + exp” is closer to truth than the “FI – MR dist” (recall that there were really 760 individual tees).\n\n\nThere is some evidence of unmodelled heterogeneity in both cases (noticeably more so with the ‘FI – MR dist’ in that the fitted detection function for observer 1 declines slower than the histogram as distance increases (Figure 1). This is less the case for the ‘FI – MR dist + size + sex + exp’ model – not surprisingly, because it models the effect of more variables causing the heterogeneity.\n\n\nBoth are still somewhat negatively biased, but the 95% confidence intervals do include the true value1. Both models are reasonable fits to the data (non-significant chi-squares, Cramer-von Mises and KS tests) – although the fit is noticeably worse in the case of the ‘FI – MR dist’ model. The ‘dist + size + sex + exp’ model has a much lower AIC and so is to be preferred on that basis.\n\n\nSpecifying new models\n\n\nI tried two models with interaction terms (although many other models could have been tried) – one with a sex times exposure interaction (‘FI – MR dist + sex x exp’) and one with a three-way interaction between distance, sex and exposure (‘FI – MR dist x sex x exp’). The former had a slightly lower AIC than the model with the 3-way interaction. The estimated N from this model was also closer to truth (Table 1).\n\n\nPoint independence\n\n\nThe point independence model with just Distance in the MR model (‘PI – MR dist DS hn’) had a slightly lower AIC than the corresponding full independence model (‘FI – MR dist’), however, the abundance estimate is much closer to truth (Table 1). We can expect the bias to be smaller for the point independence model because the assumption of independence only on the trackline is weaker than assuming independence everywhere.\n\n\nComparing the previous best FI model (‘FI – MR dist + sex x exp’) with the equivalent PI model with no covariates in the DS part (‘PI – MR dist + sex x exp DS hn’), the former had a lower AIC, and similarly for a model with no interactions in the MR model (model ‘PI – MR dist + sex + exp DS hn’). The difference in bias between FI and PI models is less for these models with more covariates, as there is less unmodelled heterogeneity that can contribute to non-independence away from the trackline (i.e., violation of the independence assumption of the FI model).\n\n\nAdding sex as a covariate into the DS model (‘PI – MR dist + sex + exp DS hn sex’) produced a model with the lowest AIC yet, and also the closest estimate (695) to true N. This model was found to have lowest AIC in a comparison of 40 models in Chapter 6 of Buckland et al. (2004, Table 6.5). The estimate is still less than the true N indicating, perhaps, some unmodelled heterogeneity on the trackline (or perhaps just bad luck – remember that this is only one survey).\n\n\nWas this complex modelling worthwhile? In this case, the estimated p(0) for the best model was 0.96. If we ran a conventional distance sampling analysis (i.e. single platform), pooling the data from the two observers, we should get a very robust estimate of N. We did this in the final analysis in the solutions Distance project (GolfteeSolutions.zip). (To do this, we selected only records where Observer = 1 regardless of whether they were seen by that observer or not – i.e. we use data from both observers combined, who will have a higher p(0) than either of them on their own.) The estimate of N from the CDS analysis is 706 – slightly closer to truth than our best MRDS model. (You can do the same thing in the mrds package in R, by specifying in the ddf function method = “ds”. Once you have a fitted detection function you can then pass this into the dht function to get an abundance estimate. The resulting estimate of abundance of clusters is identical (assuming you used the same half-normal key function we used in the Distance project; the estimate of abundance of individual is slightly different because Distance for Windows uses cluster size regression by default, while ddf does not – feel free to ask about this if you’re interested!)\nTable 1 Summary of the fitted models, AIC and estimated individual abundance, N.\n\n\n\n\nModel name\nAIC\nEstimated N\n\n\n\n\nFI-MR dist\n452.81\n593\n\n\nFI-MR dist + size + sex + exp\n407.40\n642\n\n\nFI-MR dist + sex * exp\n403.80\n682\n\n\nFI-MR dist * sex * exp\n404.46\n679\n\n\nPI-MR dist DS hn\n452.03\n688\n\n\nPI-MR dist + sex * exp DS hn\n406.34\n675\n\n\nPI-MR dist + sex + exp DS hn\n406.04\n666\n\n\nPI-MR dist + sex + exp DS hn sex\n399.26\n695\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Fitted detection function using the models ‘FI-MR dist’ (left plot) and ‘FI-MR dist+size+sex+exp’ (right plot).\n\n \nII. Crabeater Seal Survey\nThe solution is divided into Distance in windows and Distance in R section.\nDistance in Windows\n\nThe MCDS goodness-of-fit statistics all indicate adequate fit (none are significant at the 5% level) and the abundance estimate is not far from that for the PI model used in the paper: 3,820 with CI (3,168; 4,606) vs 3,969 with CI (3,274; 4,812) from the MRDS model. Use of an MCDS model results in an estimate only 4% lower than that from the MRDS model and the CVs for the two models are very similar - so the MCDS model seems pretty adequate.\n\n\nWhy is this? It is because the MRDS estimate of p(0) for both platforms combined is 0.988 – i.e. the conventional distance sampling assumption that p(0) is 1 is very nearly satisfied.\n\n\nThe full-independence (FI) MRDS analysis is not adequate. The very poor fit to the combined distance data is clear from the plots headed “Detection Probability 1”, “Detection Probability 2” and “Detection Probability 3”, which show the distribution of Obs1, Obs2 and combined Obs detections, with the Obs 1, Obs 2 and combined detection functions overlaid. It can also be clearly seen from the Q-Q plot and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test statistic.\n\n\nThe plot headed “Detection Probability 4” shows the duplicates and the duplicated detection function. The plots headed “Detection Probability 5” and “Detection Probability 6” are the conditional detection functions for each observer overlaid on the respective duplicate proportions.\n\n\nNotice that the conditional detection function fits are pretty good. So the model seems adequate for modelling the conditional probability of one observer detecting a group, given the other observer detected it, but not for the unconditional probability of detecting a group (which is what we want to estimate). This implies that there is something about detected groups that tends to make them more detectable than other groups (i.e., some unmodelled heterogeneity). So treating the conditional detection functions as if they applied to undetected groups will lead to positive bias in estimating their detection probability and negative bias in estimating abundance.\n\n\nThe severe negative bias in the abundance estimate is apparent from a comparison of the FI and PI estimates: the former is 2,509 with CI (2,070; 3,041), which is substantially lower than even the MCDS estimate, while the latter is 3,969 with CI (3,274; 4,812).\n\n\nNote that PI estimators cannot be lower than the corresponding CDS or MCDS estimators.\n\n\nOne final note: FI abundance estimates will not in general be lower than MCDS estimates, even when the FI assumption fails, as it has here. In particular, when p(0) is low, the FI estimator is likely to be less biased than the MCDS estimator. In this example, p(0) is very close to 1, so the MCDS estimator has small bias.\n\nDistance in R\nFitting a simple MRDS model (i.e. DS half-normal key with MR model distance only) gives an\nMRDS estimate of p(0) for both platforms combined of 0.988. The \\(p(0)\\) for each observer team was 0.89. Note that the estimate is the same for each team because ‘observer’ was not included in the MR model.\nCrabeater seals with MCDS\nThe detection function model with the lowest AIC includes side of plane and visibility – this is the distance sampling model used in (Borchers et al., 2006) and (Southwell et al., 2007).\n\n\n\nFormula\nAIC\n\n\n\n\nNo covars\n22304.01\n\n\nside\n22304.74\n\n\nvis\n22311.34\n\n\nside + vis\n22300.13\n\n\n\nFrom the simple MRDS analyses, we see that the conventional distance sampling assumption, that p(0) is 1, is very nearly satisfied – and so in this case an MCDS analysis may have been adequate. However, a double platform survey and analysis were required to establish this.\nReferences\nBuckland ST, Anderson DR, Burnham KP, Laake JL, Borchers DL and Thomas L (2004) Advanced Distance Sampling.

    "text": "Analysis of double platform data\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance for Windows exercise\n\n\n\nThis version of the practical is for those who would like to conduct the analysis in Distance (Thomas et al., 2010). There is a separate version for conducting the analysis in R.\nThe first part of this practical involves initial analysis of a survey of a known number of golf tees. This is intended mainly to familiarise you with the analysis features in Distance. We will do this during a short in-class break on the first day of class.\nThe second part of the practical involves more detailed analysis of the golf tee data, and an exploration of the double-platform data structure and project setup.\nThe third part of the practical involves analysis of the pack-ice seal survey data of (Borchers et al., 2006) and (Southwell et al., 2007).\n\nGolf Tee Survey – Initial analysis\n\n\nThe Golf Tee Data and Distance Project\nThe data come from a survey of clusters of golf tees in grass, conducted by undergraduate statistics students at the University of St Andrews. For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume that all the data were collected on one 210 metre long transect line out to a width of 4 metres (both sides), and that this comprises the study region. There were 250 clusters of tees in the study region and 760 individual tees in total.\nThe population was independently surveyed by two observer teams. The following data were recorded for each detected group: perpendicular distance, cluster size, observer (team 1 or 2), “sex” (males are yellow, females green and golf tees occur in single-sex clusters), and “exposure”. Exposure was a subjective judgement of whether the cluster was substantially obscured by grass (exposure=0) or not (exposure=1). The lengths of grass varied along the transect line, and the grass was also slightly more yellow along one part of the line compared with the rest.\nThe data are stored in the distance project GolfteesExercise.zip. Open the project within Distance, and click on the Analyses tab. Two Analyses have been set up for you:\n\n“FI – MR dist” is a model with only perpendicular distance as a covariate in the mark recapture detection function model.\n“FI – MR dist + size + sex + exp” is a model with distance, cluster size, sex and exposure as covariates in the mark recapture detection function model.\n\nHave a look at the Properties of the Model Definition for each of these models, and familiarize yourself with the contents of each tab.\n\nBoth specify trial configuration (see the Method button in the Detection Function tab) – team 2 setting up trials for team 1. That’s the configuration we’ll use throughout this exercise, but for this dataset an independent observer configuration would also be fine and you’re welcome to explore that yourself.\nBoth are full independence models (we’ll try point independence models later in the exercise).\nThe difference between the two is that they have different MR (mark recapture) models – see the MR Model button in the Detection Function tab. Notice that the names used in the model formulae are not the same as the field names in the Data tab – for example the “Perp distance” field is called “distance” in the formulae. (Recall from the lecture that some fields get renamed when the data are sent out to R for analysis. You can find out what renaming has been done in the Log tab once you’ve run an analysis – we’ll do this in a second.)\n\n\n\nGolf Tee Survey Analyses\n\nEstimation of p: distance only\n\n\nRun the “FI - MR dist” analysis. Once it is run, look in the Analysis Details Log tab, and find the part of the log where Distance tells you how it has renamed the fields. It’s useful to know where this is in case you need reminding of what names to use when specifying formulae. Now look in the Results tab. Does the fit of the model look good?\n\n\nHere’s what the plots are:\n\n\nThe plots on the pages headed “Summary 1” and “Summary 2” show the histograms of distances for detections by either, or both, observer. The shaded regions show the number for observer 1 and observer 2, respectively.\nThe plot on the page ‘Summary 3’ shows the histograms of distances for duplicates (detected by both observers).\nThe plot on page headed ‘Summary 4’ shows the histograms of distances for observer 2. The shaded regions indicate the number of duplicates – for example, the shaded region is the number of clusters in each distance bin that were detected by Observer 1 given that they were also detected by Observer 2 (the “|” symbol in the plot legend means “given that”). [Note that if an ‘io’ configuration had been chosen, there would also be a plot showing the duplicates overlaid onto distances detected by Observer 1; in a ‘trial’ configuration we are only interested in Observer 2 setting up trials.]\nQ-Q plot – this has exactly the same interpretation as a Q-Q plot in single platform analyses.\nThe plot on the page headed “Detection probability 1” shows a histogram of Observer 1 detections with the estimated Observer 1 detection function overlaid on it. The dots show the estimated detection probability for all Observer 1 detections.\nThe plot on the page headed “Detection probability 2” shows the proportion of Obs 2’s detections that were detected by Obs 1 (also see the “Summary” page). The fitted line is the estimated detection function for Obs 1 (given detection by Obs 2). Dots are estimated detection probabilities for each Obs 1 detection.\n\n\nIs there evidence of unmodelled heterogeneity? What do these results tell you about the estimates of p (average detection probability) and p(0) (detection probability at 0 distance)?\n\n\nEstimation of p: distance and other variables\n\n\nRun “FI - MR dist+size+sex+exp”. Can you explain the differences between the estimates of p and the abundance estimates between the two models? Which model would you use to estimate abundance? To decide, look at the goodness-of-fit test and AIC values from each model.\n\n\n\nGolf Tee Survey – Further exploration\n\n\nGolf Tee Survey Analyses (continued)\n\nSpecifying new models\n\n\nThe size covariate is the least significant of the covariates in the model “FI – MR dist + size + sex + exp” – its estimate is 0.078 with SE 0.183. So try creating a new model definition and analysis without this covariate. Does it have a lower AIC?\n\n\nYou can also try some models with interaction terms. For example, you would specify the interaction between sex and exposure as “sex:exposure”. If you also want both sex and exposure in as main effects (which you usually do) then the notation “sex*exposure” is shorthand for “sex + exposure + sex:exposure”. Don’t try too many of these models – leave time for the next part!\n\n\nPoint independence\n\n\nAll the models we have tried so far assume full independence – i.e. that the detections are independent between platforms at all distances. A less restrictive assumption is point independence – that the detections are only independent on the line.\n\n\nLet’s start by seeing if a simple point independence model is better than a simple full independence one. Set up a new Analysis and Model Definition, and under Detection Function | Method, choose Trial, Point independence. For the MR (mark-recapture) model, specify distance as the only covariate. You now also need to specify a DS (distance sampling) model. Start with a half-normal key function and constant scale parameter (i.e. no covariates).\nRun this model, and compare it with the corresponding full independence model (i.e., the full independence model with the same MR model). Which has the lower AIC? Which has an estimate closer to the known true abundance?\n\n\nNow try a point independence model that has a MR model the same as the MR model from your full independence analyses. Which has the lower AIC and bias? Finally, try some models where you introduce covariates into the scale parameter of the DS model (for example, try sex as a covariate).\n\n\nWhat is your final best model? What is the estimate of p and p(0) for this model? Was all this modelling necessary in this instance, given the value of p(0)? How else could you have obtained a robust estimate of abundance?\n\nGolf Tee Survey Data exploration\nIt’s worth having a look at how the data are stored for a double-observer project. Open the project, and click on the Data tab to see how the data are stored. Notice that each detected cluster appears twice in the observation layer – once for observer 1 and once for observer 2. There is a field “object” which gives a unique number to each cluster and another field “detected” which indicates whether the cluster was seen (=1) or missed (=0) by each observer. There are also fields for the other covariates: perpendicular distance, cluster size, sex and exposure. In general, covariates could also be stored in other data layers (e.g., stratum- or transect-level covariates such as habitat).\nNow click on the Survey tab and open the Survey details for “New survey”. Click on Properties to see the survey’s properties. Notice that the observer configuration is set to Double observer. We analysed these data assuming that Observer 2 was generating trials for Observer 1 but not vice versa – i.e., trial configuration, where Observer 1 is the primary and Observer 2 is the tracker. (As noted earlier, the data could also be analyzed in independent observer configuration – you are welcome to try this yourself!) Click on the Data fields tab, and notice that the Object, Observer and Detected roles are all filled by the appropriate fields – this is done by default when you are setting up a new project, if you tell Distance it is a double observer survey in the Setup Project Wizard.\n\n\nCrabeater Seal Survey\n\n\nThe Crabeater Seal Data and Distance Project\nThese data come from a helicopter survey of crabeater seals within pack-ice in the Antarctic conducted by the Australian Antarctic Division as part of their pack-ice seals program. The helicopter can only operate within a relatively short distance from the icebreaker, which acts as its base, and the ice-breaker can only go where the pack-ice is thin enough, the aerial transects cannot be randomly located. This means that design-based abundance estimation was not a valid option – abundance was estimated using density surface modelling. In this exercise, we concentrate on detection function estimation.\nThe data are stored in two distance projects: CrabbieMCDSExercise and CrabbieMRDSExercise. The first contains a multiple-covariate distances analysis of the data (assuming p(0)=1); the second contains mark-recapture distance sampling analyses of the same data.\nIn addition to distance and cluster size, the following explanatory variables are available for modelling detection probability:\n\nside: the side of the helicopter from which the seals were seen\nexp: the experience (in survey hours) of the observer\nfatigue: the number of minutes the observer has been on duty on the current flight\ngscat: group size category (1/2/≥3)\nvis: visibility category (poor/good/excellent)\nglare: Yes or No, depending on whether there was glare or not\nssmi: a measure of ice cover\naltitude: the height of the aircraft in metres\nobsname: individual observer identifier\n\nThe distance projects are set up as if the transects were random and survey area was 1,000,000 hectares. This is just a device to get Distance to produce an abundance estimate, which we can treat as a relative index of abundance.\n\n\nThe Crabeater Seal Analyses\nThe analyses described in (Borchers et al., 2006) and (Southwell et al., 2007) use the point independence method. Use the analyses in the two projects to decide whether:\n\nan MCDS analysis would have been adequate (and if so, why), and\na full-independence MRDS analysis would have been adequate (and if so, why).\n\nThe projects contain the following analyses (which have already been run, since running them takes a while):\n\nMCDS like paper: MCDS model used for the MCDS component of the analysis in the papers. This one is in the CrabbieMCDSExercise project\nPI dist only: Point independence model using only distance. This and the subsequent ones are in the CrabbieMRDSExercise project.\nFI like paper: Full independence model using the MRDS model used in the papers.\nPI as in paper: Point independence model using the same MCDS model and MRDS model as used in the papers.\n\nIf you have time, you might want to try other models and see if you can do better than the model “PI as in paper”. (However, see Tip2, below, for a timesaver.)\nTip1: remember in Distance for Windows you queue up multiple models to run one after the other (by clicking the Run button while another analysis is already running – the new model will get added to the queue), so you could always set up a series of candidate models and let them run while you do something else!\nTip2: Because the dataset is large, analyses with lots of covariates take a long time to run – and so the dataset is not very conducive to rapid learning. Hence we’ve set up a data filter that selects just 1 in 5 of the observations (it’s called “trunc 700 folds 1 and 5” – the folds 1 and 5 comes from the fact that there is a column “fold” in the dataset that divides the data into 10 equal subsets (“folds”), so we can select 1/5th of the data through the Data Selection tab of the Data Filter by selecting “fold IN (1, 5)”). If you look in the analysis set “Folds 1 and 5” you’ll see that we’ve run the three models using this subset of the data. You might want to do your further covariate selection using this subset also, just to speed up the runs. Of course, you might well find a different model is selected by AIC compared to that in the paper, because you are now only working with 1/5th of the data\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBorchers, D.

These data are more difficult to model because the region of the curve where we wish to be most precise is the region where data are most scarce.\nAssessing fit to point transect data also represents a challenge. Consequently, we use plots of the probability density function to gain perspective regarding the influence of regions of the probability density function upon lack of fit.\nTwo data sets are to be analysed: the first is a simulated data set in which both the true shape of the detection function as well as true animal density is known. Fit various detection functions to these data, also examining the effect of truncation (truncation for points is often more severe than for lines) upon estimates. Look for congruence in density estimates–as you did with a similar exercise performed on simulated line transect data in Practical 3.\nFinally, there are two optional data sets of winter wrens collected by Prof. Buckland.

What on-effort line length are we likely to achieve?\n\nThe spacing chosen by dssd of 4937.5m to generate a line length of 200km resulted in a maximum trackline length of around 261km (each exact answer will vary due to the random generate of surveys). If we choose this design then it is possible that when we randomly generate our survey we may not be able to complete it with the effort we have available.\nWe should therefore increase the spacing between the transects and re-run the coverage simulations. A spacing of 5000m gave a maximum trackline length of around 249km (see summary table of Trackline length in the output below) so we can be fairly confident that we will be able to complete any survey which we randomly generate from this design. This spacing should allow us to achieve an on-effort line length of 199km (see Line length section of design summary below).

What line length are we likely to achieve with this design? Is this higher or lower than the systematic parallel design?\n\nYou were asked to then run a coverage simulation and check if the trackline length was within our effort constraints. I found the maximum trackline length to be 242km (see Trackline length summary table in the output below) so within our constraint of 250km. I then got a mean line length of 221km and minimum and maximum line lengths of 212km and 227km, respectively (see Line length summary table in the output below). We can therefore expect to achieve just over 20km more on-effort survey line length with the zigzag design than the systematic parallel line design - 10% gain.

Where are they higher/lower? Why do you think this is?\n\nYou were finally asked to look at the coverage scores across the survey region to see if this design has even coverage. There are some points with lower coverage around the survey region boundary. This is actually down to the fact we are using a minus sampling strategy. If we plotted coverage scores from a systematic parallel design we would see a similar pattern.\nUsually edge effects from minus sampling are minor unless we have a very long survey region boundary containing a small study area. If using a zigzag design was causing us issues with coverage we would expect to see higher coverage at the very top or very bottom of the survey region (as our design angle is 0). We do not see this. The survey region boundaries at the top and bottom are both quite wide and perpendicular to the design angle, in this situation zigzag designs perform well with regard to even coverage."

What is the minimum number of samplers you will achieve in each strata? Is this sufficient to complete separate analyses in each stratum?\n\nMy design statistics indicated I should achieve between 22 and 27 transects in the main stratum and between 12 and 18 in the Morton Lochs stratum. I might be a bit concerned about the possibility of only achieving 12 transects in the Morton Lochs stratum (remember I cannot just discard a survey due to the number of transects and generate another as it will affect my coverage properties).\nWhether this is sufficient will depend on a number of things such as a) objectives of the study, b) number of detections per transect etc. Information from a pilot study would be useful to help decide how many transects are required as a minimum.\n\n\n\n\nplot(coverage.tentsmuir, strata=1)\nplot(coverage.tentsmuir, strata=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage scores main stratum Tentsmuir Forest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage scores Morton Lochs stratum Tentsmuir Forest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\nDoes it appear that you that there is even coverage within strata?\n\nThe main strata looks to have fairly uniform coverage. The values appear to have such small levels of variability that the variability that is seen will be down to stochasticity as it is seen across the entire strata. The Morton Lochs strata we can see has areas of lower coverage around the edge of the study region. This grid is a bit too coarse to allow us to properly judge how much of an issue edge effects will be in this strata. It may be wise to re-run the coverage simulation with a finer coverage grid and more repetitions too. Edge effects could potentially be problematic in such small areas."

If we choose this design then it is possible that when we randomly generate our survey we may not be able to complete it with the effort we have available.\nWe should therefore increase the spacing between the transects and re-run the coverage simulations. A spacing of 5000m gave a maximum trackline length of around 249km (see summary table of Trackline length in the output below) so we can be fairly confident that we will be able to complete any survey which we randomly generate from this design.

What line length are we likely to achieve with this design? Is this higher or lower than the systematic parallel design?\n\nYou were asked to then run a coverage simulation and check if the trackline length was within our effort constraints. I found the maximum trackline length to be 242km (see Trackline length summary table in the output below) so within our constraint of 250km. I then got a mean line length of 221km and minimum and maximum line lengths of 212km and 227km, respectively (see Line length summary table in the output below). We can therefore expect to achieve just over 20km more on-effort survey line length with the zigzag design than the systematic parallel line design - 10% gain.

Where are they higher/lower? Why do you think this is?\n\nYou were finally asked to look at the coverage scores across the survey region to see if this design has even coverage. There are some points with lower coverage around the survey region boundary. This is actually down to the fact we are using a minus sampling strategy. If we plotted coverage scores from a systematic parallel design we would see a similar pattern.\nUsually edge effects from minus sampling are minor unless we have a very long survey region boundary containing a small study area. If using a zigzag design was causing us issues with coverage we would expect to see higher coverage at the very top or very bottom of the survey region (as our design angle is 0). We do not see this. The survey region boundaries at the top and bottom are both quite wide and perpendicular to the design angle, in this situation zigzag designs perform well with regard to even coverage."

You may or may not have achieved the number of transects you requested, this will depend on the random start point calculated for your particular survey. There will also be some variability in coverage, my survey achieved a coverage of 5.7% in the main strata and 64.8% in the Morton Loch strata.\n\n\n\n\ncoverage.tentsmuir &lt;- run.coverage(design.tm, reps=250, quiet=TRUE)\nprint(coverage.tentsmuir)\n\n\n   Strata Main Area:\n   __________________\nDesign:  systematically spaced transects\nSpacing:  NA\nNumber of samplers:  25\nDesign angle:  0\nEdge protocol:  minus\n\n   Strata Morton Lochs:\n   _____________________\nDesign:  systematically spaced transects\nSpacing:  NA\nNumber of samplers:  15\nDesign angle:  0\nEdge protocol:  minus\n\nStrata areas:  14108643, 715265\nRegion units:  m\nCoverage Simulation repetitions:  250\n\n    Number of samplers:\n    \n        Main Area Morton Lochs Total\nMinimum      23.0         12.0  36.0\nMean         25.2         14.9  40.1\nMedian       25.0         15.0  40.0\nMaximum      27.0         18.0  44.0\nsd            1.0          1.1   1.5\n\n    Covered area:\n    \n        Main Area Morton Lochs     Total\nMinimum 689091.57    347637.32 1053462.8\nMean    770183.06    412775.77 1182958.8\nMedian  774499.08    411380.70 1186411.4\nMaximum 820781.44    468079.63 1272770.3\nsd       28098.82     24703.41   39292.3\n\n    % of region covered:\n    \n        Main Area Morton Lochs Total\nMinimum      4.88        48.60  7.11\nMean         5.46        57.71  7.98\nMedian       5.49        57.51  8.00\nMaximum      5.82        65.44  8.59\nsd           0.20         3.45  0.27\n\n    Coverage Score Summary:\n    \n         Main Area Morton Lochs      Total\nMinimum 0.00000000    0.2160000 0.00000000\nMean    0.05463220    0.5793000 0.07982633\nMedian  0.05400000    0.6280000 0.05600000\nMaximum 0.10800000    0.7080000 0.70800000\nsd      0.01876262    0.1150379 0.11642338\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\nView the design statistics. What is the minimum number of samplers you will achieve in each strata? Is this sufficient to complete separate analyses in each stratum?\n\nMy design statistics indicated I should achieve between 22 and 27 transects in the main stratum and between 12 and 18 in the Morton Lochs stratum. I might be a bit concerned about the possibility of only achieving 12 transects in the Morton Lochs stratum (remember I cannot just discard a survey due to the number of transects and generate another as it will affect my coverage properties).\nWhether this is sufficient will depend on a number of things such as a) objectives of the study, b) number of detections per transect etc. Information from a pilot study would be useful to help decide how many transects are required as a minimum.\n\n\n\n\nplot(coverage.tentsmuir, strata=1)\nplot(coverage.tentsmuir, strata=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage scores main stratum Tentsmuir Forest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage scores Morton Lochs stratum Tentsmuir Forest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\nDoes it appear that you that there is even coverage within strata?\n\nThe main strata looks to have fairly uniform coverage. The values appear to have such small levels of variability that the variability that is seen will be down to stochasticity as it is seen across the entire strata. The Morton Lochs strata we can see has areas of lower coverage around the edge of the study region. This grid is a bit too coarse to allow us to properly judge how much of an issue edge effects will be in this strata. It may be wise to re-run the coverage simulation with a finer coverage grid and more repetitions too. Edge effects could potentially be problematic in such small areas."
