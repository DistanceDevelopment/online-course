**Introduction to Distance Sampling**

**Variance estimation for systematic designs - solutions**

Recall the situation in which we have a strong gradient in animal
density across our study region, and at the same time we also have a
difference in the lengths of our transects; such that short transects
are in areas of high animal density, and long transects are in areas of
low animal density.

## Basic variance estimation, with bootstrapping

8.  The precision is very poor: estimated density ranges from about 1000
    to 3600: a three-and-a half-fold difference over which we are
    uncertain. Given that our survey covered 40% of the triangle region,
    and had a good sample size (254 on 20 transects), this would be a
    very disappointing result in practice.

9.  Bootstrap output \[your results may differ slightly as these are
    created from a random process\]:

> Half-normal/Cosine

> Interval 2 is the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the bootstrap estimates.

9.  The bootstrap results are very similar to the analytic results, as
    we would expect. In fact, this did not used to be the case in
    previous versions of Distance, as the old analytic variance
    estimator did not perform well when there were extreme trends in
    both density and line length. You can access the previous default
    estimator under the Advanced... tab on the Variance page of the
    Model Definition Properties (its estimator R3), and more details are
    given in Fewster et al. (2009).

10. The component percentages of variance are as follows:

Component Percentages of Var(D)

-------------------------------

Detection probability : 4.3

Encounter rate : 95.7

It should ring an alarm bell to see such a high contribution from
Encounter rate. Generally we might expect encounter rate to be in the
region of 70% to 80% for line transect surveys.

## Post-stratification to improve variance estimation

4.  The precision is now greatly improved:

>
> N 1022.0 8.64 31.41 858.00 1219.0

and a much smaller and more reasonable (considering the sample size and
survey coverage) proportion of the variation comes from estimating
encounter rate:

Component Percentages of Var(D)

-------------------------------

Detection probability : 44.3

Encounter rate : 55.7

5.  The CV is now even smaller, although it could have gone either way
    since this is an estimator of the same quantity as the last question
    – just a more precise estimator.

It must be remembered that we have not made any change to our data by
the post-stratification; we are just getting a **better estimate of the
variance**. In this case, the increase in precision could make a
fundamental difference to the utility of the survey: it might make the
difference between being able to make a management decision or not.
Usually, trends will not be extreme as they are in this example, and
post-stratification will not make a great difference. Such an example is
shown below.

## Systematic designs where post-stratification is not needed

![](./media/image2.emf)The following simulated population does not
exhibit strong trends across the survey region. Otherwise, the strip
dimensions and systematic design are the same as for the previous
example.
