# **Introduction to Distance Sampling**

**Point transect exercises**

1.  Simulated point transect data from 30 points are given in project
    **PTExercise1.zip**. These data were generated from a half-normal
    detection function, and true density was 79.6 animals / ha.
    Experiment with keys other than the half-normal (uniform,
    hazard-rate and negative exponential), to assess whether these data
    can be satisfactorily analysed using the wrong model. For each key,
    determine a suitable truncation point, and decide on whether, and
    which, adjustments are needed. (Truncation points come under the
    data filter.) How do bias and precision compare between models?

2.  The projects **Wren1.zip**, **Wren2.zip**, **Wren3.zip** and
    **Wren4.zip** contain winter wren data, collected at Montrave,
    Scotland in 2004. Each project corresponds to a different method of
    data collection. Thirty-two points were defined through 33.2 ha of
    parkland (Fig. 1), and detection distances were measured in metres
    with the aid of a laser rangefinder. Three types of point transect
    data were collected: 1. standard five-minute counts; 2. the
    ‘snapshot’ method; and 3. a cue count method. In addition, line
    transect data were collected (method 4), and territory mapping was
    conducted, which gave an estimate of 43 wren territories (1.30
    territories ha<sup>-1</sup>).

1)  Select a single model for exploratory data analysis. Experiment with
    different truncation distances *w*, and select a suitable value for
    each method. Do you see potential problems with any of the data
    sets?

2)  Try other models and other model options. Use plots, AIC values and
    goodness-of-fit test statistics to determine an adequate model.

3)  ![](./media/image1.emf)Record your estimates of density for each
    method. Record also the corresponding confidence intervals. Compare
    your answers with those of others in the workshop.

3.  The Sample Projects directory contains two point transect projects,
    **Savannah Sparrow 1980.zip** and **Savannah Sparrow 1981.zip**.
    These were part of a large data set collected in Arapaho National
    Wildlife Refuge, Colorado. For both data sets, consider an
    appropriate truncation distance, decide on a suitable model for the
    detection function, and estimate density, both for each stratum
    individually and for the whole study area. You should include in
    your analysis an assessment of whether the detection function can be
    estimated from data pooled across strata, or whether separate
    estimates are needed per stratum. (This will be covered in the
    lecture discussing stratification if you don’t already know how to
    do it.)
