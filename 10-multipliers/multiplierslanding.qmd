## Multipliers and indirect surveys

It is potentially easier to estimate the density of things produced by animals (songs, dung, nests) than to estimate density of animals.  In this situation, the calculated density of animal cues needs to be transformed into an estimate of animal density.  This requires companion field investigations to estimate cue production rate and possibly, cue disappearance rate.  Those rates are termed multipliers.

This exercise presents data on a Sika deer dung study in southern Scotland, where data on dung disappearance needs to be analysed via logistic regression to produce the disappearance rate multiplier. We return to the Montrave Estate study of Prof Buckland to estimate density of winter wrens via detections of song; necessitated because of evasive movement of winter wrens in the field.
