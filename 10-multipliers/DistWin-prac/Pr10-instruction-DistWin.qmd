# Introduction to Distance Sampling

## Analysis with the use of multipliers

**The Problem**

The question is how to estimate of the density of sika deer in a number
of woodlands in the Scottish Borders. These animals are quite shy and
often will be alert to the presence of an observer before the observer
detects them, making surveys of the deer challenging. As a consequence,
indirect estimation methods have been applied to this problem. In this
manner, an estimate of density is produced for some sign generated by
deer (faecal pellets) and this estimate is transformed to density of
deer by

We will produce a pellet group density estimate, then adjust it
accordingly to account for the deposition and decay processes operating
during the time the data are being acquired. We will also take
uncertainty in the production and decay rates into account in our final
estimate of deer density.

**The Data**

Data from 9 woodlands were collected according to the survey design
shown below (note differing amounts of effort in different woodlands
based on information derived from pilot surveys).

In addition to these data, we also require estimates of the defecation
rate. From a consultation with the literature, we learn that sika deer
deposit 25 pellet groups daily. The literature source did not provide a
measure of variability of this estimate. During the course of our
surveys we also followed the fate of some marked pellet groups to
estimate the disappearance (decay) rates of a group. A thorough
discussion of methods useful for estimating decay rates and associated
measures of precision can be found in Laing et al. (2003).

There are many factors that might influence both deposition and decay
rates, and for purposes of this exercise we will make the simplifying
assumption that decay rate is homogeneous across these woodlands; with
their mean time to decay of 163 days and a standard error of 13 days.
However if you were to conduct a survey such as this, you would want to
investigate this assumption more thoroughly.

where Mike Meredith of Wildlife Conservation Society in Malaysia
thoroughly describes an analysis to estimate decay rates for animal
nests or dung.

**Analysis Exercises**

Use the Distance project **Deer pellets.zip** for the following
analyses.

1.  Adjust the multipliers in the project (replacing the place-holders
    in the project, with values provided in the previous section of this
    exercise).

2.  Fit the usual series of models (uniform, half normal, and hazard
    rate) models to the data.

3.  Select the Multipliers button in the Model Definition Properties to
    specify the layer and the field in the project database for the
    multipliers you wish to employ (along with their measure of
    precision).

4.  Produce estimates using the woodland as strata, pooling data across
    strata for fitting the detection function, but using
    woodland-specific encounter rate to produce woodland-specific
    estimates of density.

5.  Produce an overall estimate of density as mean of woodland-specific
    densities weighted by the effort allocated within each woodlot.

6.  Make special note of the components of variance (contribution of
    detection function, encounter rate, decay rate, and what happened to
    defecation rate component?) in each of the strata.
