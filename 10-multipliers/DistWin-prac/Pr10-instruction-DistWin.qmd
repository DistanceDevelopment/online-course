## The Problem

The question is how to estimate of the density of sika deer in a number of woodlands in the Scottish Borders. These animals are quite shy and often will be alert to the presence of an observer before the observer detects them, making surveys of the deer challenging. As a consequence, indirect estimation methods have been applied to this problem. In this manner, an estimate of density is produced for some sign generated by deer (faecal pellets) and this estimate is transformed to density of deer by

$$\hat{D}_{\text{deer}} = \frac{\frac{\hat{D}_{{\text{pellet group}}}}{\text{mean time to decay}}}{\text{dung production rate (per animal)}} = \frac{\text{dung deposited daily}}{\text{dung production rate}}$$

We will produce a pellet group density estimate, then adjust it accordingly to account for the deposition and decay processes operating during the time the data are being acquired. We will also take uncertainty in the production and decay rates into account in our final estimate of deer density. The complete study is described in [@marques2001].

**The Data**

Data from 9 woodlands were collected and reside in the Distance for Windows project [Deer pellets.zip](Deer pellets.zip) The design of the survey is shown below (note differing amounts of effort in different woodlands based on information derived from pilot surveys).

In addition to these data, we also require estimates of the defecation rate. From a consultation with the literature, we learn that sika deer deposit 25 pellet groups daily. The literature source did not provide a measure of variability of this estimate. During the course of our surveys we also followed the fate of some marked pellet groups to estimate the disappearance (decay) rates of a group. A thorough discussion of methods useful for estimating decay rates and associated measures of precision can be found in @Laietal03.

There are many factors that might influence both deposition and decay rates, and for purposes of this exercise we will make the simplifying assumption that decay rate is homogeneous across these woodlands; with their mean time to decay of 163 days and a standard error of 13 days. However if you were to conduct a survey such as this, you would want to investigate this assumption more thoroughly.

Pay a visit to http://www.wcsmalaysia.org/analysis/Nest_dung_decay.htm where the late Mike Meredith thoroughly describes an analysis to estimate decay rates for animal nests or dung.

## Analysis Exercises

Use the Distance project [Deer pellets.zip](Deer pellets.zip) for the following analyses.

1.  Adjust the multipliers in the project (replacing the place-holders in the project, with values provided in the previous section of this exercise).
2.  Fit the usual series of models (uniform, half normal, and hazard rate) models to the data.
3.  Select the Multipliers button in the Model Definition Properties to specify the layer and the field in the project database for the multipliers you wish to employ (along with their measure of precision).
4.  Produce estimates using the woodland as strata, pooling data across strata for fitting the detection function, but using woodland-specific encounter rate to produce woodland-specific estimates of density.
5.  Produce an overall estimate of density as mean of woodland-specific densities weighted by the effort allocated within each woodlot.
6.  Make special note of the components of variance (contribution of detection function, encounter rate, decay rate, and what happened to defecation rate component?) in each of the strata.
